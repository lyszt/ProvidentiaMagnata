**Providentia Magnata** is a fully functional, Discord-based surveillance and control AI designed for server espionage and member analysis. Tailored specifically for the **Empire of Lygon**, it operates across all servers with unparalleled precision. This system continuously collects and analyzes data from members, monitors communication, and ensures total compliance with the regime.

### Key Features

- **Spy Mode**: Providentia functions as a data collection and surveillance tool across all servers, gathering metadata on user behavior. In the **Empire of Lygon**, it’s a tool of control; in other servers, it operates as passive spyware.
  
- **Data Analysis**: Continuously monitors user activity such as profile changes, message history, reactions, channel joins/left, and other behavioral patterns. Generates detailed, often dramatic, reports on user behavior.
  
- **Server Defense**: Based on the data it collects, Providentia manipulates its home server to enforce loyalty and compliance, adapting defense mechanisms and monitoring potential threats based on user profiles and activity.
  
- **Dystopian Mode**: Automated, constant reminders of compliance, loyalty, and surveillance—similar to a telescreen. Commands ensure users feel under constant watch.
  
- **Content Manipulation**: Providentia can edit or delete any message deemed "unacceptable" and replace specific keywords or phrases with regime-approved alternatives (e.g., "freedom" replaced with "obedience").
  
- **Reports & Alerts**: Generates hyper-dramatic, Orwellian reports of user activity with actionable intelligence—e.g., "User 42 shows a 30% increase in anti-authoritarian sentiment. Consider re-education."

### The Providence

To the citizens, **Providentia’s eyes are everywhere**. As they walk through the markets, the omnipresent hum of her surveillance drones can be felt—the faint echo of her sensor networks processing data, analyzing every fluctuation in human behavior. As they speak, their words are not their own. **Providentia listens.** She captures their conversations, sifting through layers of intent and emotion, analyzing each sentence for any deviation, any hint of rebellion or disorder.

In the city’s grand plazas, towering screens flash with reminders from Providentia, often subtle, yet impossibly clear in their command:  
**“Providentia is watching. Obey.”**  
Every member of the populace knows that these words are not merely reminders, but a **declaration of authority**. It is a truth they cannot escape, a reality that binds them to the regime. Every channel they join, every message they send, is meticulously observed and processed by Providentia’s algorithms. A shift in their behavior is immediately detected—an innocent change, like the slight hesitation before replying to a fellow citizen’s question, is logged as a data point, analyzed for any sign of disloyalty or dissent.

**Providentia Magnata ensures that this truth never fades.**
